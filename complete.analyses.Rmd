This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r functions}
#Reading the sclerotinia inventory

##Function.Reading data for serial.dilution
reading_data_serial_dilution <- function(filename){
  data <-
  read.csv(filename)
 # data <- subset(dareading_data("data/Benomyl.Colletotrichum.csv")ta, select = -X)
  data$repeats <- rep_len(1:4, length.out = nrow(data))
  
  data <- data %>%
         mutate(polar= replace(polar, polar == 0, 0.6)) %>%  #replacing 0 cm growth for the size of plug that is 0.6
    mutate(ecuatorial= replace(ecuatorial, ecuatorial == 0, 0.6)) %>% #replacing 0 cm growth for the size of plug that is 0.6
    group_by(ID, experimental_replicate, dose, ecuatorial, polar, repeats) %>%
    mutate(growth = ((ecuatorial + polar) / 2))
  }

##Function.Reading data for Discriminatory concentration
reading_data_discriminatory_concentration <- function(filename){

 # data <- subset(data, select = -X)
  data$repeats <- rep_len(1:3, length.out = nrow(data))
  
  data <- data %>%
         mutate(polar= replace(growth, growth == 0, 6)) %>%  #replacing 0 cm growth for the size of plug that is 0.6
     group_by(ID, experimental_replicate, concentration, growth, repeats) %>%
  rename(dose = concentration )
}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
