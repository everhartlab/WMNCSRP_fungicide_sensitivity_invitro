# WMNCSRP_fungicide_sensitivity_invitro

This is an example of fungicide sensitivity test _in vitro_ for _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ by discriminatory concetrations  approach:

1. Serial dilution method with 6 concentrations for each fungicide from 21 baseline isolates (never exposed to fungicides) + 21 from betwenn farmer fields and fungicide field trials

2. EC50 estimated from dose-response curve by ezec-package R (Kamvar, 2016)

3. Identify a single concentration that can be a discriminatory concentration

4. Use DC to assess sensitivity of large collection 

5. Data analyses using reproducible methods
